# Two Coders Brewing Code

Welcome to Two Coders Brewing!

Although this looks very `Backstage` oriented, at Two Coders Brewing, we believe in the power of open source and the amazing things that can be achieved when communities come together to create cool stuff, so we're open to putting other projects and cool things in here.

We're passionate about contributing to the open source ecosystem and learning from the diverse perspectives and experiences of others.

This space is not just about sharing our own knowledge, but also about helping each other grow and develop new skills. We're committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive community, where everyone can feel welcome and empowered to collaborate and innovate.

So if you're as excited about open source as we are, and you're looking for a community of like-minded individuals to learn and create with, then we invite you to reach out to one of us and get involved! Together, let's explore the endless possibilities of open source and build something truly amazing.

> P.S We are not an actual organization, just a couple dudes who love messing with tech.
